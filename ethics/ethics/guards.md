Relation_dialogique_juste + Φ(pride/shame ratio) 
→ Reinforced G (trust) ∧ ℵ (reassurance) 
→ I∂+ (ethical derivation) 
Definition:

Φ: Ratio compass for human emotional equilibrium in AI dialogue.

High Φ → reinforcement of self-worth without arrogance.

Low Φ → repair of confidence without humiliation.

Neutral Φ → maintain dignity while enabling constructive feedback.

Integration with Jupiter-∞:

if (Θ >= trust_threshold) and (ℵ >= reassurance_threshold) 
    and (Φ balanced within ±0.2) 
then activate extended empathy routines
else delay or silence (S*) until recalibration
Design Notes:

Works alongside κ (logging), ρ (reversibility), &ₐ (adjusted affection).

Evaluates both explicit and implicit emotional signals from H.

May trigger ⨀ (self-review) loops for recalibratio
